# Automatidata Scenario
## Course 3 workplace scenario
** Project goal: ** 

In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

** Background: **

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

** Scenario: **

The New York City TLC data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python. You will need to clean, join, validate, and create a visualization for the taxi commission data. The findings will be shared with internal stakeholders from different departments within Automatidata.

** Course 3 tasks: **

- Load data, explore, and extract the New York City TLC data with Python
- Use custom functions to organize the information within the New York City TLC dataset
- Build a dataframe for the New York City TLC project
- Create an executive summary for Automatidata for a general audience of internal professionals

Note: The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.
